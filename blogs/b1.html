      <h2>Is Learning Computer Programming Or Coding Haram?</h2>
      <div class="thespace">
        In our world today almost every sector of life needed a computer to
        boost working performance and for easy accessibility of data and
        information.
        <br /><br />
        The invention of the computer has added a significant change in every
        aspect of our life. The internet for example as improve the way valuable
        information are been sent from one country to another without a glitch.
        <br /><br />
        Almost every household possesses a different variety of computerized
        gadget and appliances ranging from smartphones, laptops, televisions,
        decoder, CCTV cameras, printers, e.t.c.
        <br /><br />
        These items were made by computer programmers by implementing the
        knowledge of computer programming to create these products for end
        users.
        <br /><br />
        So here brings the question.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>Is Learning Computer Programming Or Coding Haram?</h3>
        <br />
        From the above uses and benefits of a computer talked about at the
        beginning has proven how a computer is inevitable for both Muslims and
        Non-Muslims.
        <br /><br />
        Learning computer programming or coding as a Muslim is not Haram because
        you are seeking knowledge to make the world a better place and less hard
        for people.
        <br /><br />
        According to one of the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him);
        <br /><br />
        “Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.” (At-Tirmidhi)
        <br /><br />
        This lesson gives insight into the reasons behind Islam giving great
        importance to seeking knowledge and its benefits for mankind.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>What Makes Computer Programming Haram?</h3>
        <br />
        Learning how to code will expose you to a lot of things in the computer
        field, both the good and sophisticated ones. It now depends on what you
        choose to do with it.
        <br /><br />
        Creating spying software or apps that infiltrate into people’s privacy
        to steal their personal data and information is prohibited in Islam.

        <br /><br />

        Allah has forbid Muslims not to spy, as He stated in the glorious Quran;
        <br /><br />
        Believers…. do not spy… (Quran 49:12)
        <br /><br />
        This does not base on spying alone; also building mobile applications or
        software that produces haram contents such as:
        <br /><br />
        Blackhat <br />
        Gambling <br />
        Pornography <br />
        Interest <br />
        Misinformation <br />
        Fake news, are all prohibited in Islam.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>What Makes Computer Programming Halal?</h3>
        <br />
        Computer programming or coding deals with writing codes for the computer
        to perform a certain task. Every Muslim should make sure that the tasks
        should not contradict the Qur’an and Sunnah.
        <br /><br />
        There are various channels you can use the knowledge of programming
        which will benefit Muslims ummah at large and also earn you a humongous
        reward.
        <br /><br />
        Below are examples of halal ideas Muslim can do with computer
        programming skill:
        <br /><br />
        Islamic education app for Muslims <br />
        Qur’an recitation software (e.g. iQuran) <br />
