      <h2>How to Be a Productive Programmer</h2>
      <div class="thespace">
        Productivity in programming is a misleading concept. Veteran coders
        often define productivity as getting more things done with fewer lines
        of code. Performance freaks warn against boilerplate code which abuses
        computing power in a race to get more done.
        <br /><br />
        For an average coder, programming productivity boils down to just one
        thing: Getting more story points done as defined by their tech lead, at
        least by Friday.
        <br /><br />
        In a 9–5, five-day workweek with daily stand-ups, that’s what gives you
        a sense of accomplishment: smooth demos, and not-so-bad feedbacks—no
        matter how many regressions it produces three months afterward.
        <br /><br />
        So here are some programming productivity tips to prevent those
        humiliating moments when you have to overwork to compensate for prior
        lapses.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Always Begin With UI/Test Case Development</h3>
        <br />
        If your project involves UI, beginning with UI implementation at the
        start of feature development always pays. No matter how much you argue
        against it, UX decides its value to the users.
        <br /><br />
        But there’s a UX person on the team — isn’t this their responsibility?
        <br /><br />
        Absolutely. But a working demo always triggers second thoughts in a
        team’s collective psyche. People, by nature, tend to find areas of
        improvement upon a second look.
        <br /><br />
        Unless you wrote 100% decoupled code, a UI change will mostly trigger
        view-model change, which may cause major rewriting of modules/classes.
        <br /><br />
        UI development also allows stakeholders to have a sense of early
        validation of their ideas. It gives the whole team some sense of
        progress, which gives you, the feature developer, some room in
        forthcoming sprints. You can utilize this stress-free time to develop
        the model and networking parts.
        <br /><br />
        If there is no UI, you will do well to start by doing test case
        development. The benefits of TDD are hailed across the industry, and you
        will surely reap its rewards later in the development cycle.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>…Except When You Should Begin With Writing Bad Code</h3>
        <br />
        How would you start on a novel file compression tool if you had never
        zipped a file programmatically?
        <br /><br />
        UI is out of the question here. Tests are helpful, but may not give you
        any sense of accomplishment/validation at first.
        <br /><br />
        What you need here is not productivity, but some force that will drive
        you through this novel development. Some motivation.
        <br /><br />
        A belief that this can be done. And you can do it.
        <br /><br />
        Validate the core idea first, without caring about UI/tests/function
        parameters. Measure your results:
        <br /><br />
        How time- and space-efficient is your compression algorithm, compared to
        gzip and its peers?
        <br /><br />
        How much would the industry pay to choose it over freely available
        solutions?
        <br /><br />
        Discuss your findings with your team. Give them something to boast about
        in Friday coder parties or investor summits.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn’t really matter at this stage if you hardcoded your
        COMPRESSION_QUALITY_RATIO, or skimped on file-size validations.
        <br /><br />
        The key factor here is not successful completion or sophisticated
        implementation, but being in a position to decide whether you can do it,
        and whether the team can go with this tool/approach to buy more time to
        make an MVP.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Be Generous With CPC (Copy/Paste/Clone)</h3>
        <br />
        A generation of programmers has popularized the idea that a developer
        who has to copy-paste code from StackOverflow or GitHub isn’t a good
        programmer.
        <br /><br />
        They belong to the paper-trail generation when there wasn’t enough
        Internet. At the same time, they also rarely worked on diversified
        technologies/languages. So they worked hands-on, right from the API
        docs.
        <br /><br />
        The thing is, in order to be efficient in the things that matter most,
        all effective coders heavily rely on copy-pasting common functionality.
        <br /><br />
        A file-writing code snippet copied from the StackOverflow top dev’s
        answer will be 1000 times better than your own version conjured up from
        reading horrible docs.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, your talent will shine through in deciding whether to invoke
        that file-write from UI main thread, a background thread or to eliminate
        it through some caching.
        <br /><br />
        Again, copy-paste that backgrounding/caching code from somewhere else,
        and put them together.
        <br /><br />
        All great chefs have gone through this. After some years, you will be in
        the perfect position to come up with your signature recipes.
        <br /><br />
        Read, Read and Read
        <br /><br />
        If I had 8 hours to chop down a tree, I would spend 6 of those hours
        sharpening my axe.
        <br />
        — Traditional
        <br /><br />
        When browsing tech stories about development, you’ll see that learning
        important programming concepts is as important as completing your story
        points in time.
        <br /><br />
        Knowledge about industry best practices leads to exponential improvement
        in:
        <br /><br />
        Quality of code you produce
        <br /><br />
        Ideas you discuss in meetings
        <br /><br />
        Your long term career
        <br /><br />
        The tech world at large
        <br /><br />
        If you have to deliver a feature at Thursday’s stand-up meeting, you
        should spend your entire Monday reading about it, without even writing
        single line of code.
        <br /><br />
        Make Google your friend. Try different search combinations surrounding
        the topic, the libraries and frameworks involved, and the deeper
        concepts.
        <br /><br />
        For example, if you had to write an authentication module for a website,
        your online reading must include OAuth, Passport and other third-party
        modules, and password encryption.
        <br /><br />
        Copy/paste/clone should ideally begin on Tuesday evening, or even
        Wednesday morning when you are completely familiar with the concepts,
        code snippets, and callbacks.
        <br /><br />
        By that time, you’ll be in a position to copy-paste from the best
        source.
        <br /><br />
        If your team/tech lead disapproves of it even within acceptable limits,
        it’s a red flag about your career in the current company. Follow this
        strategy:
        <br /><br />
        Disobey them by continuing to read. If you want to avoid confrontation,
        peruse your programming book in transit. Of course, office-time
        suggested research does not include watching your favorite celeb’s
        Instagram feed unless you’re developing an Instagram competitor. That’s
        the perfect excuse.
        <br /><br />
        Keep delivering.
        <br /><br />
        Go on job interviews, and jump ship when you are leveled-up enough from
        your reading. A programming workplace that sees reading as a
        non-productive practice is not worth working for.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <br />
        Unlike other industries where production can be measured in units per
        hour per worker, programming productivity has no universal standards.
        Sprints help us define it, but are still quite subjective.
        <br /><br />
        Following certain efficiency techniques helps you boost estimation
        power. With better estimates, you can deliver better quality code in
        better time. Always remember that productivity should never include
        sacrificing your personal life.
        <br /><br />
        These programming productivity tips are just a start. As you grow in
        experience, cultivate your personal best with constant experimentation:
        experimentation with your tasks, with your colleagues, and most
        importantly, with your habits.
