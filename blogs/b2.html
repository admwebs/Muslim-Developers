      <h2>6 Reasons Every Muslim Should Learn Computer Programming</h2>
      <div class="thespace">
        A lot of Muslims are active on Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Google,
        Twitter, Snapchat, Whatsapp, and many more.
        <br /><br />
        Most do not know how these social media applications or websites are
        created talkless of how they generate billions of dollars yearly.
        <br /><br />
        It is clear that we are in the era of science and technology, Muslims
        should not be left out to participate in making the world a better
        place, through creating productive and extensive apps that will
        positively impact the lives of their fellow Muslims and non-Muslims.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>What is Computer Programming or coding?</h3>
        <br />
        Computer Programming is a creative process of writing useful code for
        the computer to perform a meaningful, maintainable and extensive task.
        <br /><br />
        These codes are written in a computer language that runs through a
        compiler that enables the computer to understand for easy interpretation
        to produce meaningful output.
        <br /><br />
        There are various programming languages that are specialized in
        performing different tasks for a computer.
        <br /><br />
        Below are some of the most common computer languages:
        <br /><br />
        HTML & CSS <br />
        JavaScript <br />
        C++ <br />
        Ruby <br />
        Python <br />
        C <br />
        PHP <br />
        SQL <br />
        ASP .NET and many more.
        <br /><br />

        <h3>Why Muslims should learn programming or coding?</h3>
        <br />
        Today, almost everything is run by computer.
        <br /><br />
        They are made possible by the use of computer programming to bring
        flexibility into our day to day activities.

        <br /><br />

        Imagine our life without a computer; it will be hard to communicate,
        receive and send information all around the globe by pressing just a
        button.
        <br /><br />
        Below are the key reasons why Muslims should learn computer programming
        or coding:
        <br /><br />
        <h3>1. Dawah</h3>
        <br />
        Dawah means inviting or preaching of Islam. There are various medium
        Muslim could use to spread the teaching of Islam through computer
        programming – particularly the social media platforms (such as facebook,
        twitter, Instagram).
        <br /><br />
        Spreading the teaching of Islam is quite easy and effective on social
        media just by creating engaging contents (posts or videos) online that
        reaches people from different demographics. These contents may be videos
        of notable scholar, Quranic verses, and sayings of The Prophet.
        <br /><br />
        You can make a mobile (Android) application, websites, and desktop
        programs. That will serve mainly for dawah (just like Muslim Pro, Muslim
        Central, Hadith app, zakat calculator, iQuran, e.t.c), where Muslims
        from diverse origin come together to seek for guidance and help
        themselves grow intact in faith and righteousness.
        <br /><br />
        Let there arise among you a group inviting to all that is good,
        enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil. Those are the successful
        ones. – (Quran 3 verse 110)
        <br /><br />
        According to the above verse, it means you are creating a cycle of
        bringing Muslims together to learn about Islam, and doing this will earn
        you immense and uncountable rewards in this life and the hereafter (day
        of resurrection).
        <br /><br />
        <h3>2. Work From Anywhere</h3>
        <br />
        The interesting part of being a programmer is that you can work from
        anywhere (be it at home, coffee bar, restaurant, on the beach, and so
        on) or as a freelance by having just your laptop and internet connection
        - because almost everything you will need is computer base.

        <br /><br />

        It gives you the chance to create your zone and make you feel
        independent to do whatever you wish at your own convenient time.
        <br /><br />
        You will enjoy the free will to go to the masjid (mosque) to offer
        salaah at the prescribed time without any boss intimidating or
        questioning your religious belief.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>3. High Job Opportunity</h3>
        <br />
        The need to fill the role of a computer programmer in organizations is
        increasing in developed, developing and underdeveloped countries.
        <br /><br />
        Their skills are needed in almost every sector, from financing,
        architecture, construction, manufacturing, health, e.t.c.
        <br /><br />
        To be a certified computer programmer you must have a BSc degree in
        computer science or any science related course such as Mathematics.
        <br /><br />
        Though, possessing adequate experience in computer programming without a
        science degree or no degree can still land you a well-paid job base on
        your deep knowledge in the field.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>4. Buoyant Salary Structure</h3>
        <br />
        According to payscale.com below is the annual salaries earn by computer
        programmers/software engineer/ developer by nationality: <br /><br />
        U.S. $80,825 <br />
        Saudi Arabia – $25,585.92 <br />
        Indonesia – Rp 68,400,000 <br />
        Turkey - $72,921 <br />
        Malaysia - $8,567.50 <br />
        India – $6,310.59 <br />
        Nigeria - $5,050 <br />
        <br />
        <h3>5. Make You A Billionaire</h3>
        <br />
        Do not be fooled by the “B” word. Not all programmers are billionaires.
        <br /><br />
        Acquiring the rightful knowledge (needed) in computer programming can
        make you a billionaire by implementing this knowledge into solving real
        human problems and ease communication, data flow, information and time
        efficiency.

        <br /><br />

        There are a lot of people who have become billionaires in the field of
        computer programming. To mention a few, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of
        Facebook is worth $80b, Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft is worth $90b.
        <br /><br />
        This is achievable in your case too if you put hard work and full
        dedication in presenting humanity with productive innovation that will
        shape their life positively.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>6. Improves The Way You Think</h3>
        <br />
        The fundamental of programming or coding is the ability to solve
        problems. Finding solutions to these problems requires logical and
        in-depth thinking.
        <br /><br />
        Engaging practically with coding will gradually boost your brain and
        maximize your mental muscle to formulate patterns to get a difficult
        task solved.
